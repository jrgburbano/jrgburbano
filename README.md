# Hi, I'm Jorge! 👋

# Welcome to my corner on GitHub!

I am a DevOps and Cloud Computing student. I have some basic knowledge on frontend technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also familiarized with Linux System Administration and Bash Scripting. My professional goal is to obtain certification as a DevOps and Cloud Specialist, as I am drawn to the idea of combining my taste for Cloud Computing and Automation Processes.

## About Me

- 📚 Currently, I am studying at Platzi, preparing myself to achieve my goals in DevOps and Cloud Computing.
- ✈️ I love to travel, explore new places, and tasting the local cuisine. Fortunately, I have some experience with this.
- 🎸 I am a musician, I like to play drums and guitar in my spare time. Let's jam sometime!
