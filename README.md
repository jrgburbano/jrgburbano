# Hi, I'm Jorge! 👋

# Welcome to my corner on GitHub!

I am a software development student. I have some basic knowledge on frontend technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My professional goal is obtaining certification as a DevOps specialist, as I am drawn to the idea of combining my taste for backend development with operational practices such as implementation and deployment in this role.

## About Me

- 🌍 I live in Bogotá, Colombia. I have a beautiful family, I love hanging out with them.
- 📚 Currently, I am studying at Platzi, preparing myself to achieve my goals in DevOps engineering.
- ✈️ I love to travel, explore new places, and tasting the local cuisine. Fortunately, I have some experience with this.
- 🎸 I am a musician, I like to play drums and guitar in my spare time. Let's jam sometime!
